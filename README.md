# freeCodeCamp-projects
All of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jarikmarwede) projects I built for the [Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jarikmarwede/legacy-front-end), the Back End Development Certification and the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jarikmarwede/responsive-web-design).

Go to https://jarikmarwede.github.io/freeCodeCamp-projects/ to check them out.

The original projects are the ones that were committed first.
Go to the [commit page](https://github.com/jarikmarwede/freeCodeCamp-projects/commits/master) to check them out.
