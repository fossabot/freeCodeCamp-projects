# freeCodeCamp-projects
All of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jarik-marwede) projects I built for the [Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jarik-marwede/front-end-certification) and the Back End Development Certification.

The Front End projects can also be found on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jarikmarwede) and the Back End pojects on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@jarik-marwede).

The original projects are the ones that were commited first.
Go to the [commit page](https://github.com/jarikmarwede/freeCodeCamp-projects/commits/master) to check them out.
